## The Bletchley Cluster

*Summary: Bletchley is a powerful computer open for use by anyone in the Oxy community.*

Bletchley is a *high-performance computing (HPC) cluster* - a (network of) computers that work together to perform computations. Bletchley is Oxy's own cluster, the result of an [NSF MRI grant](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1919771). In a lot of social and physical sciences, research increasingly involves processing large amounts of data or finding the optimal configuration out of many possible parameters. Doing this requires not only requires lots of computing power, but also multi-day run-times that Oxy's other infrastructure cannot support. The Bletchley cluster exists to support these kinds of research, and also acts as an instrument where students can learn how to apply computational methods.

Bletchley is open to be used by Oxy professors and students for teaching and research. This document serves as a technical user guide to Bletchley, and will walk through how to get access, some technical background on the command line and the workload manager, as well as starter code for running your program on the cluster.
